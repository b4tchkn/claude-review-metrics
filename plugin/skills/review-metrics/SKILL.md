# Review Metrics

Collect and analyze team review metrics from GitHub pull requests.

## Invocation

Run via the unified dispatch script:

```bash
./scripts/dispatch.sh $0 $1
```

Where `$0` is the period (default: `week`) and `$1` is the command.
If no command is provided, all rankings are shown.

## Examples

| Command | Dispatch |
|---------|----------|
| `/review-metrics` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh week` |
| `/review-metrics last-week` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week` |
| `/review-metrics month comments` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh month comments` |
| `/review-metrics last-week response-time` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week response-time` |
| `/review-metrics last-week fix-time` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week fix-time` |
| `/review-metrics last-week bottleneck` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week bottleneck` |
| `/review-metrics stuck` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh week stuck` |
| `/review-metrics last-week reviewer-load` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week reviewer-load` |
| `/review-metrics last-week cycles` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week cycles` |
| `/review-metrics last-week pr-size` | `./scripts/dispatch.sh last-week pr-size` |
